The Kite Runner, spanning Afghan history from the final days of the monarchy to
the present, tells the story of a friendship between two boys growing up in Kabul.
Though raised in the same household and sharing the same wet nurse, Amir and
Hassan grow up in different worlds: Amir is the son of a prominent and wealthy
man, while Hassan , the son of Amir's father's servant, is a Hazara. Their intertwined
lives, and their fates, reflect the eventual tragedy of the world around them. When
the Soviets invade and Amir and his father flee the country for a new life in
California, Amir thinks that he has escaped his past. And yet he cannot leave the
memory of Hassan behind him.
