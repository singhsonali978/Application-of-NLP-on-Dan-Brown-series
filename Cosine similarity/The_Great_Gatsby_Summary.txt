The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz 
Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society 
enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as
 the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale 
and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made
 millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized 
crime, for example the Jewish mafia. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick 
Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was
 uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of 
morality that went with it, a kind of decadence.
