I have developed a generic algorithm using NLTK’s Part-of-Speech tagger and Word Tokenizer along with SpaCy’s Entity Detector to determine the Protagonist of any book.
I analyzed the similarities between summaries of the books using GloVe’s Pre-trained word vectors and Scipy’s Cosine distance model. 
Along with that I performed Sentimental Analysis on the books using Sklearn’s TF-IDF vectorizer, NRC’s word emotion lexicon and VADER’s Sentiment Intensity Analyzer.
I have visualized the acquired results using Word Cloud, Heat Map, Graphs, Stack Plot and Venn Diagrams.


Note: The folder structure is as required by the code. To run the Cosine Similarity project, you need to download glove.60b.50d.txt from this link - https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/glove-global-vectors-for-word-representation.
